## Description

A single-page React Portfolio application with my skills information, links to more information about me, samples of my work, and an experience timeline.

## Installation

npm install

## Issues

There are no issues at this time.

## User Story

AS an average Joe with experience building single-page applications 
<br/>
I WANT to provide a potential employer with a deployed React portfolio with samples of my work
<br/>
SO THAT they can assess weather I am a good candidate for an open position
<br/>

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
<br/>
WHEN I load the portfolio
<br/>
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
<br/>
WHEN I view the header
<br/>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
<br/>
WHEN I view the navigation titles
<br/>
THEN I am presented with the titles Home, Projects, Experience
<br/> 
WHEN I click on a navigation title
<br/>
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading
<br/>
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
<br/>
THEN the Home section is selected by default
<br/>
WHEN I am presented with the Home section
<br/>
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
<br/>
WHEN I am presented with the Projects section
<br/>
THEN I see titled images of three of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
<br/>
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
<br/>
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
<br/>
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
<br/>
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
<br/>
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
<br/>
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
<br/>
WHEN I am presented with the Experience section
<br/>
THEN I see a timeline of my work experience
<br/>
WHEN I view the footer
<br/>
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and future links to my profile on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook (future links are currently linked back to the Home page)
